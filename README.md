For the Bootstrap, please look at commit e929e0a
## The 'Five' Features of Bootstrap
1. Custom NavBar (took perhaps the longest time for integration)
2. The Input Form
  -> and the custom response
3. The Two Iframes
4. The Jumbotron
  -> use of badges
5. The Image Carousel
6. The UglyWebsite Modal
7. The Battleship Images (and using rows)
8. Example of using row on first page
9. All of the Individual Paragraphs surrounded by Containers
10. All asociated buttons with previous features
## Favorite Feature?
Definitely the download button on Battleships
## Notes
<I know this doesn't sound like a lot of features, however, I spent a lot of time trying to perfect them>
