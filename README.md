# Pixel Arcade
For the most recent update (and my biggest game to date), please see commit fa91b04.
## There are four games
1. Typing Tutor
2. Color Spinner
3. CPS Tester
4. Wack-a-Mole
5. Chrome Dinosaur Game (NEW!)

## Notes
This is a more JavaScript oriented project for me (or at least that is where I allocated most of my time). I really wanted to emulate a real website, which has features that the user can interact with. And that is what I attempted to do, create games that the user could engage (not really on an intellectual level, but we will get there) with.

Update: I have replicated the Chrome Dinosaur Game and I am rather proud how it turned out!

Thank you and have a fantastic break!
